# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    head_1: "HERE'S WHAT YOU GET"
    text_1: "All the clinical and administrative features of expensive PC-based dental systems, but much simpler to use. It makes it easy to share files and collaborate on treatment plans without ever having to manage emails and faxes, enabling your clinic to literally go paperless – from the moment patients enter their medical history to the moment you get paid. Scheduling, exams, treatment planning, progress notes, all is efficiently done using our software – your practice in hand. Everything is seamless."
    f_header_1: "More easy"
    f_text_1: "Unlike services that are not web-based (or not in the cloud), our service does not require that you obtain additional hardware and software, design internal networks, invest in a central server, or additional, reliable systems and accommodations for data storage. You don’t need to back-up your information, update your software, or upgrade your hardware. All you need is just to register."
    f_header_2: "Future"
    f_text_2: "Move with technology and choose the best. Now is the time to save money, understand your business better and communicate with your customers more quickly and cheaply. At our system we can help innovative and modern practices with an online dental solution that will delight and fulfil all the requirements of the Practice Owners, Dentists, Clinicians, Hygenists, Nurses, Practice Managers, Receptionists and Patients."

    head_2: "Who are we?"
    text_2: "Our service is a powerful, web-based dental practice management software application, which can be configured to the needs of any type of dental practice."
